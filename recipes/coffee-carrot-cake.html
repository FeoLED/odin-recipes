            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 
                350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch 
                baking pan with foil. Coat foil with cooking
                spray.
            </li>
            <li>For batter, whisk together flour, baking powder,
                cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Beat softened butter in a large bowl with an electric
                mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in sour 
                cream, then white sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in 
                eggs, 1 at a time.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in carrots and vanilla. Fold in flour mixture with a 
                rubber spatula until just combined.
            </li>
            <li>Spread batter in prepared pan. The batter will be shallow, 
                but will increase in volume as it bakes.
            </li>
            <li>For streusel, combine walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, and 
                salt in a small bowl. Stir in melted butter until crumbly. 
                Spinkle streusel over cake batter.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into 
                the center of cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let 
                cool in pan for 10 minutes; lift from the pan with edges 
                of the foil.
            </li>
            <li>For glaze, beat together cream cheese and butter in a small 
                bowl until smooth. Beat in 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, then powdered sugar. 
                Beat in enough milk to make drizzling consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Serve coffee cake warm or at room temperature. Drizzle glaze over warm 
                or cooled cake, or over each serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
