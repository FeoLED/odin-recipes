        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease and flour a 9-inch Bundt pan.
            </li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric 
                mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well 
                after each addition. Beat in sour cream and vanilla extract. 
                Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into 
                butter mixture until just blended. Fold in blueberries.
            </li>
            <li>Spoon 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Combine brown sugar, 
                pecans, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle 1/2 of the mixture over batter 
                in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Spoon reamaining batter on top, then sprinkle over remaining 
                pecan mixture. Use a knife or thin spatula to swirl the sugar layer 
                into the cake.
            </li>

                out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool briefly on a wire rack.
