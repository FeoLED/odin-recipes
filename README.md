The present project shows how I build a recipe website. 
Here I put in practice what I learned about HTML, using headings, img tags, ordered and unordered lists, and connecting a main page (index) with different recipes through links (anchor tag). Each recipe webpage conects back to the index one through and anchor tag ("Home")
